Create dynamic forms, generate PDF certificates, and validate authenticity with magic link access.

== Description ==

Free Form Certificate is a complete WordPress solution for creating dynamic forms, generating PDF certificates, scheduling appointments, and verifying document authenticity. Built with a fully namespaced, modular architecture using the Repository pattern and Strategy pattern for maximum maintainability.

* **Magic Links** - One-click certificate access via unique, cryptographically secure URLs sent by email.
* **Verification System** - Certificate authenticity validation via unique code or magic token.
* **QR Codes** - Auto-generated QR codes on certificates linking to the verification page.

= Self-Scheduling (Personal Calendars) =

* **Calendar Management** - Create multiple calendars with configurable time slots, durations, and business hours.
* **Appointment Booking** - Frontend booking widget with real-time slot availability.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `ffcertificate` folder to `/wp-content/plugins/`.
2. Activate the plugin through the "Plugins" menu in WordPress.
3. Navigate to "Free Form Certificate" to create your first form.
4. Use the shortcode `[ffc_form id="FORM_ID"]` on any page or post.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I create a form? =

1. Go to "Free Form Certificate" > "Add New Form".
2. Enter a title and use the Form Builder to add fields.
3. Configure the certificate layout in the "Certificate Layout" section.
4. Save and copy the generated shortcode.

= What are Magic Links? =

Magic Links are unique, secure URLs sent via email that allow recipients to instantly access and download their certificates with a single click. Each link contains a cryptographically secure 32-character token.

= How do I set up the verification page? =

The plugin creates a `/valid` page automatically during activation. You can also create a page manually with `[ffc_verification]`.

= How do I create a calendar? =

1. Go to "Free Form Certificate" > "Calendars" > "Add New".
2. Configure business hours, slot duration, and capacity.
3. Use the shortcode `[ffc_calendar id="CALENDAR_ID"]` on any page.

= Can I restrict who generates certificates? =

Yes. In each form's "Restriction & Security" section you can enable allowlist mode, use the ticket system, block IDs via denylist, or restrict by geographic area via geofencing.

= How do I translate the plugin? =

The plugin is fully translation-ready with the `ffcertificate` text domain. Use Loco Translate or Poedit with the `languages/ffcertificate.pot` template file. Portuguese (Brazil) translation is included.

== Changelog ==

= 4.9.6 (2026-02-14) =

Editable user profile, orphaned record linking, and username privacy fix.

* New: **PUT /user/profile** REST endpoint — users can update display_name, phone, department, organization from the dashboard
* New: **Profile edit form** in user dashboard — toggle between read-only view and edit form with save/cancel actions
* New: **Phone, department, organization** fields displayed in the read-only profile view
* New: **Orphaned record linking** — `get_or_create_user()` now retroactively links submissions and appointments that share the same cpf_rf_hash but had no user_id
* New: **Appointment capability auto-grant** — when orphaned appointments are linked, appointment capabilities are granted automatically
* Fix: **Username = email** privacy issue — `create_ffc_user()` now generates username from name slug (e.g. "joao.silva") instead of using email; fallback to `ffc_` + random string
* Fix: **MigrationUserLink** updated to use `generate_username()` for new user creation during migration
* New: `UserManager::generate_username()` public method — generates unique slugified username from name data

= 4.9.5 (2026-02-14) =

LGPD/GDPR compliance: WordPress Privacy Tools integration (Export & Erase Personal Data).

* New: **Privacy Exporter** — 5 data groups registered with WordPress Export Personal Data tool:
  - FFC Profile (display_name, email, phone, department, organization, member_since)
  - FFC Certificates (form_title, submission_date, auth_code, email, consent)
  - FFC Appointments (calendar, date, time, status, name, email, phone, notes)
  - FFC Audience Groups (audience_name, joined_date)
  - FFC Audience Bookings (environment, date, time, description, status)
* New: **Privacy Eraser** — registered with WordPress Erase Personal Data tool:
  - Submissions: anonymized (user_id=NULL, email/cpf cleared; auth_code and magic_link preserved for public verification)
  - Appointments: anonymized (user_id=NULL, all PII fields cleared)
  - Audience members/booking users/permissions: deleted
  - User profiles: deleted
  - Activity log: anonymized (user_id=NULL)
* New: **PrivacyHandler class** with paginated export (50 items/batch) and single-pass erasure
* New: Encrypted fields decrypted during export for complete data portability

= 4.9.4 (2026-02-14) =

User profiles table, user deletion handling, and email change tracking.

* New: **`ffc_user_profiles` table** — centralized user profile storage (display_name, phone, department, organization, notes, preferences)
* New: **User deletion hook** — `deleted_user` action anonymizes FFC data (SET NULL on submissions/appointments/activity, DELETE on audience/profiles)
* New: **Email change handler** — `profile_update` action reindexes `email_hash` on submissions when user email changes
* New: **Profile methods** in UserManager — `get_profile()`, `update_profile()`, `create_user_profile()` with upsert logic
* New: **Profile migration** — `MigrationUserProfiles` populates profiles from existing ffc_users (display_name, registration date)
* New: **REST API profile fields** — `GET /user/profile` now returns `phone`, `department`, `organization` from profiles table
* New: **UserCleanup class** — handles `deleted_user` and `profile_update` hooks with activity logging
* Fix: **uninstall.php** — added `ffc_user_profiles` to DROP TABLE list and migration options to cleanup

= 4.9.3 (2026-02-14) =

Capability system refactoring: centralized constants, enforced checks, simplified role model.

* New: **Centralized capability constants** — `AUDIENCE_CAPABILITIES`, `ADMIN_CAPABILITIES`, `FUTURE_CAPABILITIES` and `get_all_capabilities()` method in UserManager
* New: **Audience context** — `CONTEXT_AUDIENCE` constant and `grant_audience_capabilities()` for audience group members
* New: **`download_own_certificates` enforced** — users without this capability no longer receive `magic_link`/`pdf_url` in dashboard API
* New: **`view_certificate_history` enforced** — users without this capability see only the most recent certificate per form
* Fix: **CSV importer capabilities** — replaced 3 hardcoded `add_cap()` calls with centralized `UserManager::grant_certificate_capabilities()`
* Fix: **uninstall.php cleanup** — added 4 missing capabilities: `ffc_scheduling_bypass`, `ffc_view_audience_bookings`, `ffc_reregistration`, `ffc_certificate_update`
* Fix: **Admin UI save** — `save_capability_fields()` now references `UserManager::get_all_capabilities()` instead of hardcoded list
* Changed: **Simplified role model** — `ffc_user` role now has all FFC capabilities as `false`; user_meta is the sole source of truth
* Changed: **Removed redundant reset** — `reset_user_ffc_capabilities()` no longer called during user creation (role no longer grants caps by default)
* Changed: **`upgrade_role()` uses centralized list** — new capabilities added as `false` automatically

= 4.9.2 (2026-02-13) =

UX improvements, race condition fix, and PHPCS compliance.

* New: **Textarea auto-resize** — textarea fields in certificate forms grow automatically as user types (up to 300px, then scrollbar), with manual resize support

* Fix: **Form field labels capitalization** — labels now respect original formatting regardless of theme CSS
* Fix: **LGPD consent box overflow** — encryption warning no longer exceeds consent container bounds
* Fix: **Form field attributes** — corrected esc_attr() misuse on HTML attributes (textarea, select, radio, input)
* Fix: PHPCS compliance — nonce verification, SQL interpolation, global variable prefixes, unescaped DB parameters, offloaded resources, readme limits

= 4.9.1 (2026-02-12) =

Calendar display improvements, custom booking labels, audience badge format, and bug fixes.

* New: **Audience badge format** option per calendar — choose between name only or "Parent: Child" format
* New: **Custom booking badge labels** per calendar — configurable singular/plural labels for booking count in day cells (with global fallback)
* Fix: **Geofence GPS checkbox** not saving when unchecked — added hidden sentinel field so unchecked state is properly persisted
* Fix: **Migration cascade failure** — removed `AFTER` clauses from ALTER TABLE migrations that caused silent failures when referenced columns didn't exist
* Fix: **Booking labels missing** from logged-in user config — bookingLabelSingular/bookingLabelPlural were only passed in the public config path
* Fix: **Public calendar event details** — REST API now returns description, environment name, and audiences for non-authenticated users on public calendars

= 4.9.0 (2026-02-12) =

New field types, Quiz/Evaluation mode for scored forms, and certificate quiz tags.

* New: **Event list panel** — optional side or below panel showing upcoming bookings for the current month
* New: Event list admin settings — enable/disable and position (side or below calendar)

* New: All-day events display "All Day" label instead of time range in day modal and event list
* New: Holidays now displayed in event list panel alongside bookings (sorted by date)

* New: **Booking Cancel** button in admin — AJAX cancel with confirmation prompt and mandatory reason

* Fix: Environment label not reaching frontend — `get_schedule_environments()` now includes `name` field in config
* Fix: Environment label fallback "Ambiente" was not wrapped in `__()` for translation
* Fix: Holiday names no longer shown in calendar day cells — displays generic "Holiday" label only (full name in event list)
* Fix: Holiday label fix applied to both audience and self-scheduling calendars

* Changed: Calendar max-width adjusted to 600px standalone, 1120px with event list (600px + 20px gap + 500px panel)
* Changed: Calendar day cells now use `aspect-ratio: 1` for consistent square grid layout
* Changed: Environment colors shown as left border on booking items in day modal and event list
