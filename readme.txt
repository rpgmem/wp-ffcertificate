Create dynamic forms, generate PDF certificates, and validate authenticity with magic link access.

== Description ==

Free Form Certificate is a robust WordPress solution for creating dynamic forms and automated certificate issuance. The plugin features a fully modular architecture with specialized classes for maximum maintainability and extensibility.

= Key Features =

* **Drag & Drop Form Builder:** Intuitive interface to create custom fields (Text, Email, Number, Date, Select, Radio, Textarea, Hidden).
* **Client-Side PDF Generation:** Uses html2canvas and jsPDF to generate A4 landscape certificates with support for custom background images.
* **Magic Links (NEW in v2.8.0):** One-click certificate access via unique URLs sent in emails.
* **Verification System:** Validation shortcode `[ffc_verification]` for certificate authenticity via unique code.
* **ID-Based Restriction (CPF/RF):** Control unique issuance or "reprint" mode based on document.
* **Ticket System:** Import list of exclusive codes for form access.
* **Advanced Security:** Bot protection with integrated Math Captcha, Honeypot, and rate limiting.
* **Data Export:** CSV export tool with filters by form and date.
* **Asynchronous Notifications:** Email sending to administrator via WP-Cron to not block user flow.
* **Automatic Cleanup:** Daily routine to delete old records according to configuration.
* **Modular Architecture:** 15 specialized classes following Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `wp-ffcertificate` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Access the 'Free Form Certificate' menu to create your first form.
4. Use the shortcode `[ffc_form id="FORM_ID"]` on any page or post.
5. Check your email for the magic link to access your certificate instantly!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I create a form? =

1. Navigate to "Free Form Certificate" > "Add New Form"
2. Enter a title for your form
3. Use the Form Builder to add fields
4. Configure the certificate layout in the "Certificate Layout" section
5. Save and copy the shortcode

= What are Magic Links? (NEW in v2.8.0) =

Magic Links are unique, secure URLs sent via email that allow recipients to instantly access and download their certificates without entering codes or solving captchas. Each link contains a cryptographically secure 32-character token that provides one-click access.

Example: `https://yoursite.com/valid?token=a1b2c3d4e5f6...`

= How do I enable the verification page? =

The plugin automatically creates a `/valid` page during activation. You can also manually create a page with the shortcode `[ffc_verification]`.

= Can I restrict who can generate certificates? =

Yes! In the "Restriction & Security" section of each form, you can:
- Enable whitelist mode (only listed IDs can generate)
- Use ticket system (unique codes)
- Block specific IDs via denylist

= Are Magic Links secure? =

Yes! Magic Links use:
- 32-character cryptographically secure tokens (340 undecillion possible combinations)
- Rate limiting (10 attempts per minute per IP)
- No expiration (links work forever, but can be disabled by deleting the submission)
- Unique per submission (cannot be guessed or reused)

= How do I translate the plugin? =

The plugin is fully translation-ready. Use tools like Poedit or Loco Translate to create translations from the `languages/ffc.pot` file.

= Can I extend the plugin with custom functionality? =

Yes! The modular architecture makes it easy to extend. Each class has a single responsibility and can be extended or replaced independently.

== Magic Links Usage ==

= How Magic Links Work =

1. **User submits form** → Certificate is generated
2. **Email is sent** with magic link button
3. **User clicks button** → Taken to verification page
4. **Certificate preview loads** automatically (no captcha)
5. **User downloads PDF** with one click

= Magic Link Format =
```
https://yoursite.com/valid?token=a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0k1l2m3n4o5p6
```

= Email Example =

The user receives an email with:
- Authentication code (for manual verification)
- Magic link button ("🔗 Access Certificate Online")
- Certificate preview embedded
- Manual verification URL as fallback

= Security Considerations =

**Tokens are:**
- 32 characters long (16^32 possible combinations)
- Cryptographically secure (generated with `random_bytes()`)
- Unique per submission
- Never expire (but can be invalidated by deleting submission)
- Protected by rate limiting

**Rate Limiting:**
- 10 attempts per minute per IP address
- Applies to both magic links and manual verification
- Uses WordPress transients (no additional tables)
- Automatically resets after 60 seconds

= Disabling Magic Links =

Magic links cannot be disabled globally, but you can:
1. Not include them in custom email templates
2. Delete submissions to invalidate their tokens
3. Use only manual verification workflow

== Layout & Placeholders ==

In the certificate layout editor, you can use the following dynamic tags:

= System Tags =
* `{{auth_code}}`: 12-digit authentication code
* `{{form_title}}`: Current form title
* `{{submission_date}}`: Issuance date (formatted according to WP settings)
* `{{submission_id}}`: Numeric ID of the submission in database
* `{{validation_url}}`: URL of the verification page

= Form Field Tags =
* `{{field_name}}`: Any field name defined in Form Builder
* Common examples: `{{name}}`, `{{email}}`, `{{cpf_rf}}`, `{{ticket}}`

= Formatting Notes =
* CPF/RF fields are automatically formatted with dots and dashes
* Auth codes are formatted as XXXX-XXXX-XXXX
* Date fields respect WordPress date format settings

== Shortcodes ==

= [ffc_form] =
Displays the certificate issuance form.

Parameters:
* `id` (required): Form ID

Example: `[ffc_form id="123"]`

= [ffc_verification] =
Displays the certificate verification interface.

Automatically detects magic links via `?token=` parameter.

No parameters required.

Example: `[ffc_verification]`

**Magic Link Access:**
When accessed with `?token=` parameter, displays certificate preview automatically without captcha.

**Manual Access:**
When accessed without token, displays traditional verification form with captcha.

Extend `FFC_Form_Processor` and override validation methods.

**New shortcodes:**
Extend `FFC_Shortcodes` class with additional render methods.

= Hooks & Filters =

**Filters:**
- `ffc_allowed_html_tags`: Modify allowed HTML tags in certificates

**Actions:**
- `ffc_process_submission_hook`: Triggered after submission save (receives magic_token)
- `ffc_daily_cleanup_hook`: Triggered daily for cleanup
- `ffc_continue_token_migration`: Continuation of large migrations

**AJAX Actions (NEW in v2.8.0):**
- `ffc_verify_magic_token`: Magic link verification (no captcha)
- `ffc_verify_certificate`: Manual verification (with captcha)
- `ffc_submit_form`: Form submission

= Testing =

Each class can be unit tested independently thanks to dependency injection:
```php
// Example: Testing Magic Link Verification
$mock_handler = $this->createMock(FFC_Submission_Handler::class);
$mock_handler->method('get_submission_by_token')
             ->willReturn(['id' => 1, 'data' => '{}', 'magic_token' => 'abc123']);

$verifier = new FFC_Verification_Handler($mock_handler);
$result = $verifier->verify_by_magic_token('abc123');

$this->assertTrue($result['found']);
```

== Privacy & GDPR Compliance ==
